        <heading type="normal-medium">CDMA System Optimization</heading>
        <para>At Knowledge Systems Consulting Group, we are experts in improving the performance of CDMA (IS-95, IS-95B,
            1XRTT) systems.</para>
        <para> How do we do it?</para>
        <para>
            <bullets style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica;font-size:14px;text-decoration:none;color:#000000;">
                <slug> First, we drive exhaustively through the market to collect a comprehensive
                    drive-data set. </slug>
                <slug> We collect from the service-provider all the key operating parameter values
                    (search window sizes, add/drop thresholds and timers, neighbor lists, etc.), as
                    well as historical drop/block performance for each sector.</slug>
                <slug> If available, we collect historical hand-off statistics for all the
                    sector-pairs, and “fuse” these various data sets in a proprietary algorithm that
                    identifies the worst problem-causers in the network.</slug>
                <slug>We use the drive-data and configuration-data to construct a propagation model
                    accurate to better than 5 dB standard deviation </slug>
                <slug> Then, in additional proprietary software routines, we derive “good” solutions
                    for improving performance.</slug>
            </bullets>
        </para>
        <para>Solutions are accomplished both in hardware and software: in hardware, with antenna
            changes and reorientations, in software, with base-station power adjustment, neighbor
            list changes, PN changes, Tadd/Tdrop modification, N-way handoff changes, etc. The
            service provider will see dramatic performance improvement after implementing the
            software changes; improvements to capacity and further improvements in quality will come
            from antenna changes. </para>
        <para>How much will a given market benefit from the Knowledge Systems Consulting Group methods? Well, the good
            engineering answer is, “it depends.” It depends on existing coverage, frequency of
            occurrence of high-FER (>5%) events, dropped-call rates, and extent of pilot-pollution.
            In general, Knowledge Systems Consulting Group can provide the most dramatic performance improvement to systems
            with complicated terrain, good coverage but dropped calls greater than 1.5 %,
            unavoidable pilot-pollution (sites around bays or lakes, mixture of high and low-sites,
            etc.), and high site-densities. Recent Knowledge Systems Consulting Group optimizations have reduced high-FER
            events by 95 percent in areas of pilot-pollution and rough terrain.</para>
        <para>At Knowledge Systems Consulting Group, we are experts in identifying problems with PN plans, and in creating
            new, ambiguity-free plans. If our initial analysis of your market reveals extensive
            PN-related problems, it may be necessary to develop a new plan. Knowledge Systems Consulting Group will quote
            the cost of required services after the intial drive-testing and after completion of a
            propagation model for the market.</para>
        <heading type="normal-medium">FDMA Frequency Planning</heading>
        <para>Knowledge Systems Consulting Group has comprehensive expertise and experience in frequency planning.
            Frequency planning is essentially the solution to the problem of allocating discrete
            channels to the individual sectors with minimal re-use distances, while meeting the
            boundary constraints of adequate C/I probabilities, n-sector separation for good
            hand-off success, avoidance of color-code, SAT, DSAT violations, etc. The numerical
            approach to finding good solutions to frequency plans is similar to the solution of
            ambiguity-free PN plans in CDMA systems.</para>
        <para>A good frequency plan is a true optimization of the conflicting goals of capacity and
            quality in FDMA systems. At Knowledge Systems Consulting Group, we depend on drive-test collection of
            signal-strength data in the market; the data is used to calibrate propagation models, as
            well as to evaluate measured C/I statistics for engineered plans. Knowledge Systems Consulting Group has
            particularly powerful solutions for service-providers using FDMA and CDMA together; CDMA
            Ec/Io data is used to facilitate frequency planning, and test-carriers put up on sectors
            involved in frequency plan revisions can help identify problems affecting the CDMA
            network. Knowledge Systems Consulting Group provides turn-key frequency-planning and CDMA system optimization
            services, from data-collection, to parameter and antenna/power design, as well as for
            maintenance of frequency plans, and incorporation of new CDMA and/or FDMA sites.</para>
