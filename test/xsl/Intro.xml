        <heading type="normal-medium">Capital or Expense? The 7 Billion Dollar Question (Ask WorldCom!)</heading>
        <para>Service-providers typically classify work performed by contract engineers to be a
            capital expenditure, if the work is directly related to new projects, and an expense, if
            it is associated with maintenance of existing infrastructure. Both CDMA Optimization and
            frequency plan revisions are essential to the introduction of new sites, so most of our
            work can be legitimately classified as a capital expenditure. Knowledge Systems Consulting Group will carefully
            log work performed in support of capital projects versus expensed activities, if we are
            given a schedule of capital projects, their locations, and all the relevant engineering
            information for the projects (heights, power, antenna orientations, coverage and
            capacity objectives). A Knowledge Systems Consulting Group invoice identifies to a detailed level the work
            performed, the project(s) supported, and the percentage of work performed that supports
            maintenance, versus capital, activities.</para>
