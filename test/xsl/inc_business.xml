                <biography>After receiving a BM degree from San Francisco State University, Jonathan
                    Lancelle's career path lead to long-term employment with the San Francisco Opera
                    and Ballet orchestras. It has been said before that music and math go together,
                    and he can certainly attest to that fact. As computer technologies advanced in
                    recent decades, so did his keen interest in all facets of the industry. From
                    learning to create relational database systems with the infamous Dbase, to
                    dabbling with Brainmaker - one of the first neural network simulators, to the
                    world of object oriented programming and its resultant parallels to neural
                    network technology – his journey has been exciting to say the least. Mr.
                    Lancelle's enthusiasm for finding solutions to complex problems has led him to
                    create Knowledge Systems Consulting Group. Some of his interests include amateur radio and sailing on San
                    Francisco Bay.</biography>

                <biography>Bernie Olshausen built, designed and tested his first communication
                    system in 1964, while in the second grade. He became addicted to communication
                    systems analysis and design when he heard his own voice in headphones attached
                    to an audio transformer, battery and carbon microphone, and it was in the same
                    year that Bernie started his studies on the French Horn. Bernie has been
                    pursuing mastery of the horn and RF Systems Engineering ever since, and brings
                    to AapaSystems the expertise derived from 20 years’ experience as an RF Systems
                    engineer, 7 years as an RF Systems technician, and over 12 years serving his
                    country in the US Air Force and Air National Guard. How does the horn fit in?
                    Bernie says that “if I can figure out how to get a good tone from this thing and
                    go clam-free (brass-player-ese for “ errorless”) in Der Freischuetz overture, I
                    can certainly figure out how to reduce dropped and block calls in CDMA
                    networks.” Bernie served in the USAF’s 234th Combat Communications Squadron as a
                    Ground Radio Communications Technician, while he pursued and completed his BS
                    Electronic Engineering degree at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. In the 80’s, Bernie
                    worked as an RF Systems Engineer and R&amp;D Program Manager for defense-related
                    projects largely concerned with communication signal detection,
                    direction-finding, and classification. In this capacity Bernie developed
                    numerous numerical simulations and models of complex communications systems; at
                    AapaSystems, Bernie has transferred these same skills and experience to finding
                    and eliminating problems in commercial networks and frequency planning. With the
                    demise of our cold-war enemies, and reduced demand for direction-finding
                    specialists, Bernie joined US West NewVector Group, in Bellevue, WA, serving as
                    Systems Engineer for the San Diego System, and, from 1992 to 1994, as Lead RF
                    Engineer for Nebraska, Iowa, the Dakotas and Duluth, WI. In 1994 Bernie joined
                    McCaw Cellular, where he first worked on testing the initial CDPD systems. In
                    1995, McCaw Cellular became part of AT&amp;T, and in this year Bernie assumed
                    responsibilities as Manager of Engineering, for development of AT&amp;T’s PCS
                    system in Southern Ohio/ No. Kentucky. After his team put 125 PCS sites (with an
                    average height of over 200 feet!) on the air in 18 months, Bernie accepted his
                    next challenge as Manager of RF and Performance Education at AT&amp;T. Since the
                    late 90’s, Bernie served as an engineering manager at Sprint PCS and Western
                    Wireless, specializing in non-abrasive management, frequency-planning, and CDMA
                    system optimization. Bernie joined AapaSystems in September 2002, and plans to
                    keep going just as he has been, in pursuing mastery and artistry in the French
                    Horn, and RF Systems Engineering.</biography>
