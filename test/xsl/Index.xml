        <para>Knowledge Systems Consulting Group specializes in the provision of world-class engineering services to the
            commercial wireless communications industry. We have developed, tested and proven
            advanced numerical-optimization methods for achieving maximal performance in FDMA
            systems (IS-136, GSM, iDEN, AMPS) with best-fit frequency plans, and with
            state-of-the-art hardware and software solutions for CDMA systems.</para>
        <para>What is the difference between Knowledge Systems Consulting Group, and all those other engineering services
            companies? At other companies, the service-provider seeks help with complex technical
            problems, and the services-company responds by placing multiple engineers in the firm,
            at a typical cost of 20,000 dollars per month per engineer. The engineers typically find
            and fix a few problems per month, and frequency planning can be an endless, ongoing task
            for several engineers. At Knowledge Systems Consulting Group, the customer only pays for benefits received. We
            charge our valued clients only for successful optimization or frequency-planning
            services provided; no ongoing, open-ended costs for engineering services!</para>
        <para>Knowledge Systems Consulting Group provides turn-key CDMA-optimization and FDMA frequency-planning services,
            freeing the engineering teams at the service-provider to focus on growth planning,
            traffic analysis and planning, site development, outage monitoring, performance
            reporting. Although Knowledge Systems Consulting Group can certainly provide such functions, these are
            traditionally activities that are performed expertly by resident engineering teams. But,
            nobody can rebuild a frequency plan, clear a new carrier for CDMA, tune a CDMA system
            for minimum drops and FER, or list needed antenna azimuth/power/orientation changes more
            economically, quicker or better than Knowledge Systems Consulting Group!</para>
